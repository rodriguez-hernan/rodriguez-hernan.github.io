      <h3>Explanation:</h3>
      <div class="explanation">
  So in this section we will discuss, javascript variables, arrays loops and conditionals.<br/>
  To learn the aplications of these topics I have decided to go through an excersise from 
  <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=2" class="topic-link">www.projecteuler.net</a>.<br/>
  This website has many excersies that need programming skills to find the solution.
  In this case we will review the "Even Fibonacci Numbers" problem.
      </div>
      <pre class="problem-explanation">
        Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is
        generated by adding the previous two terms.
        By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

        1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

        By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence
        whose values do not exceed four million,
        find the sum of the even-valued terms.
      </pre>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-5 explanation inline">
        So, to start we have to set some variables to hold the information.
Here we create one variable to hold a list of fibonacci numbers (called array), that we will complete in a while,
and 3 other variables that will help us form the fibonacci sequence (these will contain numbers).
        </div>
        <div class="col-6 code inline">
          <pre>
            <code>
  var fibos = [1,2];
  var previousA = 1;
  var previousB = 2;
  var current = 3;
            </code>
          </pre>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-5 explanation inline">
        Now we are going to make use of a loop, in this case, a while loop. This takes a condition that will 
evaluate in every iteration, and while the condition is true, it will keep looping.<br/>
Here we used a method of Arrays to add values to our array previously defined. We add the previous 2
values and add them to the array, then, reasign the variables for the next iteration.
      </div>
      <div class="col-6 code inline">
        <pre>
          <code>
  while(current<4000000) {
    fibos.push(current);
    previousA = previousB;
    current = current + previousB
    previousB = current - previousA
  }
          </code>
        </pre>
      </div>
    </div>
        <div class="col-5 explanation inline">
Now we have an array of fibonacci numbers!
So, for the next step, we can make another type of loop and add a conditional.
What we will do, is loop through the array we build and create a new one, but only using the even numbers.
So, the if statement inside the loop, checks if the number we are iterating through is even or not using
the modulo operator.
      </div>
      <div class="col-6 code inline">
        <pre>
          <code>
  var evenFibos = [];
  for(var i = 0; i &lt; fibos.length; i++) {
    if (fibos[i] % 2 === 0){
      evenFibos.push(fibos[i]);
    }
  }
          </code>
        </pre>
      </div>
      <div class="col-5 explanation inline">
We can also use the 'filter' function of arrays, to loop through our array and just select the even ones.
<br/>
This gives us the same result.
      </div>
      <div class="code col-6 inline">
        <pre>
          <code>
 var evenFibos = 
    fibos.filter( (a) => a % 2 === 0; );
          </code>
        </pre>
      </div>
      <div class="col-5 explanation inline">
          We have a second array of even fibbonacci numbers!
          Now we can use another loop that iterates throug every element of an array. 
          This one is easier, it receives a function as a parameter, so we can just add each value of the array to 
          a variable that we create.           
      </div>
      <div class="col-6 code inline">
        <pre>
          <code>
  var sum = 0;
  evenFibos.forEach(function(number){
    sum += number;
  })
          </code>
        </pre>
      </div>
      <div class="col-5 explanation inline">
          Now we have our number!  (4,613,732)
